# Project 2

**Title:** [Student_performance](product_sales_dashboard.xls)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Power Query, PivotTables, Data Visualization, Dashboard Design, Sales Analysis, Business Insights)

**Project Description:** The Student Performance Analysis project explores the relationship between academic outcomes and key influencing factors such as exam scores, gender, parental involvement, distance from home, family income, and school type. The aim was to identify patterns that impact student achievement and provide actionable insights for improving educational performance and support systems.

Using Microsoft Excel, the dataset was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed to uncover meaningful trends. The resulting interactive dashboard presents a comprehensive view of student performance, helping educators, policymakers, and stakeholders make informed decisions to enhance learning outcomes and equity in education.

**Key findings:**

Parental involvement showed a strong positive correlation with higher exam scores especially for male students with medium parental engagement performed significantly better than those with high and low involvement.

Family income and School type influenced performance as well; students from medium-income families tended to score better than those with high-icome and also Students attending public perform better than those attending private schools.

Students staying close to the school with more access to resources performed better than those that don't.

Gender performance differences revealed clearly that the male students scored higher than the female students.

Public school students generally outperformed their private school counterparts, particularly in consistency and overall average scores.

**Dashboard Overview:** The Excel dashboard offers an intuitive and visual summary of student performance metrics across various dimensions. It includes dynamic charts, pivot tables, and slicers that allow users to explore data interactively based on gender, income level, and parental involvement.

# Project 3

**Title:** Workplace Safety

**SQL Code:** [HR Database - SQL Code](https://github.com/070175302/Richardtel.github.io/blob/main/Workplace.SQL)

**SQL Skills Used:** 
1.  Data Retrieval (SELECT): Queried and extracted specific information from the database.
2.  Data Aggregation (SUM, COUNT): Calculated totals, such as sales and quantities, and counted records to analyze data trends.
3.  Data Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, AND): Applied filters to select relevant data, including filtering by ranges and lists.
4.  Data Source Specification (FROM): Specified the tables used as data sources for retrieval

**Project Description:** 
The Workplace Safety SQL Analysis Project focuses on using SQL Server to analyze and interpret data from an HR database to support safety monitoring and decision-making within the organization. The project demonstrates the use of essential SQL querying techniques to retrieve, filter, and aggregate workplace safety–related information.

By leveraging SQL functions such as SELECT, SUM, and COUNT, the project extracts key insights, including the total number of safety incidents, employee participation in safety programs, department-level safety statistics, and overall safety performance trends. Data filtering using WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, and AND was applied to narrow down records by date ranges, departments, categories, and incident types.

The project also emphasizes accurate source selection through the FROM clause to ensure data is retrieved from the correct HR tables. The final output provides meaningful summaries that can assist management in understanding safety patterns, identifying high-risk areas, and making data-informed decisions to improve workplace safety protocols.

Built using SQL Server, this project showcases practical data analysis skills applicable to real workplace environments, demonstrating how SQL can be used to enhance safety oversight and support organizational compliance efforts.

**Technology Used:** SQL Server
